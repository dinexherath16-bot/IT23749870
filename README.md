# IT23749870

Playwright test suite for the IT23749870 project.

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

**Install dependencies:**
Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```powershell
npm install
npx playwright install
```

**Run the tests:**

```powershell
npm test
# or
npx playwright test
```

**View the HTML report:**
- After a test run, open the Playwright report with:

```powershell
npm run show-report
# or
npx playwright show-report
```


**Tests location:**
- Test files are in the `tests` folder, for example: [tests/IT23749870- transliteration.spec.ts](tests/IT23749870-%20transliteration.spec.ts#L1).

**Troubleshooting:**
- If browsers are missing, re-run `npx playwright install`.
- If tests fail due to environment, ensure Node.js version and required OS dependencies are installed.

If you want, I can run the tests now or add a `README` section showing how to run a single test file or debug a failing test.
